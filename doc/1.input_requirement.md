## Senario
Data type contains a single routing scenario for one school

| Name     | Type        | Comment                     |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| school   | Int         |                             |
| id       | Int         |                             |
| routeIDs | Vecotr(Int) | List of stops for the route |

## Route
Object represents a single route
By convention, stops are ordered from the furthest to school to the nearest.
