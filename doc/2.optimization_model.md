## Routing: Bi-objective Routing Decomposition (BiRD)
Decomposing the routing problem:

1. single-school
    1. stop assignment 
    2. single-school routing
2. multi-school
    1. scenario selection
    2. bus scheduling


### Stop Assignment
#### Set/Parameters

| Identifier | Index/Set Domain  | Comment                                              |
|------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| schools    | S                 | set of schools                                       |
| students   | P                 | set of students                                      |
| $P_s$      | $s \in S$         | set of students attending school s                   |
| Locations  | C                 | set of all locations can serve as bus stops          |
| $C_p$      | $C_p \subseteq C$ | Allowed bus stops for student $p \in P_s$            |
| $d_{p,c}$  |                   | walking distance for student p to a stop $c \in C_p$ |

For student p with special needs may require a "door-to-door" pickup: the set
$C_p$ is a singleton ${c}$, where $d_{p,c} = 0$.


The objective is to minimize the number of stops for each schools and the total walking distance.
This is similar to a facility location problem. 

#### Variable

$z_c$: binary whether stop c is selected for school S. 

$y_{p,c}$: binary whether student p is assigned to stop c. 

#### Objective and Constraints

For each school S:

$$ min \sum_{c \in C} z_c + \beta \sum_{p \in P_s} \sum_{c \in C_p} d_{p,c} y_{p,c}$$

subject to:

1. student p is assigned to c only if stop c is selected for school s.
$$y_{p,c} \leq z_c,  \forall p \in P_s , c \in C_p$$

2. Each student is assigned to 1 stop
$$\sum_{c \in C_p} y_{p,c} = 1 ,\forall p \in P_s $$


Where $\beta$ is the trade-off of the total number of stops and walking distance.
